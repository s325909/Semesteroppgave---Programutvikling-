# Game info
This is a 2D top-down type of survival game whereas the goal is to survive until a specific stage. The player progresses through stages by eliminating the zombies on the board, using a small arsenal of weaponry. The player has health and armor points, and once health is depleted, the game is over. Once defeated, each zombie leaves behind either a type of ammunition, or health or armor points.

The game is not in a satisfactory finished state due to bugs and missing features. Collision detection, projectile handling, and level design all need more work to make the game enjoyable. However, given the bump in difficulty from previous programming subjects and our level of experience at project completion, we're mostly satisfied with what we were able to accomplish.
