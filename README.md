# Game info
This is a 2D top-down type of survival game whereas the goal is to survive until a specific stage. The player progresses through stages by eliminating the zombies on the board, using a small arsenal of weaponry. The player has health and armor points, and once health is depleted, the game is over. Once defeated, each zombie leaves behind either a type of ammunition, or health or armor points.

The game requires more work with collision detection, projectile handling, and level design.
